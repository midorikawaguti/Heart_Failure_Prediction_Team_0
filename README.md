## Business case

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading global health concern, with significant impacts on both mortality rates and economic stability.
According to the report provided by American Heart Association: CVD, listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the
United States in 2021. The economic burden of cardiovascular risk factors and overt cardiovascular disease is projected to increase substantially in
the coming decades. Annual health care costs are projected to almost quadruple, from $393 billion to $1490 billion, and productivity losses are
projected to increase by 54%, from $234 billion to $361 billion.(https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001258)
Early detection of the people under cardiovascular risk can help to mitigate the financial burden on the healthcare system and improve preventive measures to manage the condition.

## Objective
 + Analyze the downloaded dataset
 + Build Machine Learning classification model to predict heart failure based on certain features
 + Identify features which contribute the most to the correct prediction
 + Evaluate model metrics (need to add which ones)
   
To do that, we will be working on the following dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

This dataset contains combined data from 5 sources and has a total of 918 observations (after 272 duplicates have been deleted). There are 12 attributes
in this dataset.
